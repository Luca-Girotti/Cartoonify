# Cartoonify
A friendly simple cartoonify algorithm written in python!

This program takes as an input a picture and basically "cartoonify it" (makes it look like a cartoon) !

Not gonna lie, I had a nice time making it ! Not quite sure if this can be considered as a low level machine learning !?

Feel free to check it out :D

REQUIREMENT:
-Tkinter
-OpenCV-Python
-Numpy
